**BACKGROUND** : Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine neoplasm, accounting for approximately 1.7% of all human malignancies [1]. Thyroid cancer is usually classified into four types: papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), anaplastic thyroid cancer, follicular thyroid cancer, and medullary thyroid cancer [2]. Among the four types, PTC is the most common, accounting for 75â€“85% of all thyroid cancer cases [3]. PTC is usually curable and has a 5-year survival rate of over 95% [4]. However, PTC occasionally dedifferentiates into more aggressive and lethal thyroid cancers. Additionally, recurrences are observed in approximately 30% of patients with PTC. Therefore, further analyses of the molecular characteristics of this disease are necessary [5]
