# Background:

Metabolic syndrome, called "MetS",  is characterized by systemic disturbances that increase cardiovascular risk. Adiponectin (Ad) is an adipocytokine, exhibits a cardioprotective function because of its anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerotic properties. In the blood, this adipocytokine circulates on multimers (Admer), among which high molecular weight (HMW) are the most active forms. Because alterations of Ad plasmatic levels, Admer distribution and receptor (AdipoR) expression have been described in murine models and obese patients, strategies that aim to enhance Ad production or its effect on target tissues are the subject of intense investigations. While exercise training is well known to be beneficial for reducing cardiovascular risk, the contribution of Ad is still controversial. 

# Methods:

At 6 weeks of age, mice were submitted to a standard (SF) or high-fat high-sugar (HF) diet for 10 weeks. After 2 weeks, the SF- and HF-fed mices were randomly assigned to a training program (SFT, HFT) or not (SFC, HFC). The trained groups were submitted to sessions of running on a treadmill 5 days a week.

# Results and conclusions: 

HF mice presented the main problems associated with MetS (increased caloric intake, body weight, blood glucose and body fat), a change in the Admer distribution in favor of less active forms and an expression of increased AdipoR2 in the muscles. In contrast, physical training has reversed some of the adverse effects of an HF diet, such as increasing glucose tolerance, which is the best control of calorie intake. There is therefore no change in the production of Ad and the Admer distribution. However, increased expression of AdipoR1 muscle was observed in trained mice, but this effect was curbed by an HF diet. These data confirm a recent hypothesis suggesting a functional divergence between AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, AdipoR1 having the predominant protective action on metabolic function.
