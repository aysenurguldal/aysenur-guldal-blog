title: "Identification of key genes and mi RNAs markers of papillary thyroid cancer"
description: |
  Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine neoplasm, accounting for approximately 1.7% of all human malignancies. Thyroid cancer is usually classified into four types : papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), anaplastic thyroid cancer, follicular thyroid cancer, and medullary thyroid cancer. Amoung the four types, PTC is the most common, accounting for 75-85% of all thyroid cancer cases. PTC is usually curable and has a 5 year survival rate of over 95%. However, PTC occasionally dedifferentiates into more aggressive and lethal thyroid cancers. Additionally, recurrences are observed in approcimately 30% of patients with PTC. Therefore, further analyses of the molecular characteristics of disease are necessary.
